# Troy Tips

TroyTips is a project made for HackSC's Hack Nights. I'll be using this project
to teach students the basics of web development.

The idea is that this application will let users submit USC campus related tips
to a shared feed.

Hopefully, attendees will learn HTML/CSS, GET/POST requests, and
Node.js + MongoDB basics.
